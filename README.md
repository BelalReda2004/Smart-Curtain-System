# Smart-Curtain-System

## 🔍 Overview  
The Smart Curtain System is a hardware automation project that uses digital logic gates and an LDR sensor to control curtain movement based on ambient light — without any microcontroller.

## 🛠 System Description  
This system leverages TTL logic principles to open/close curtains based on light input and manual controls.

## 🎛 Key Inputs  
- *LDR (Light Dependent Resistor):* Detects ambient light.  
- *LC (Local Control):* Manual switch control.  
- *SC (Set Control):* Optional configuration input.  
- *SO (System Override):* Forces curtain state.

## 🔁 Logic Design  
Built with *AND, **OR, **NOR, and **NOT* gates (7400 series). Entirely logic-based — no code!

## 🧪 Simulation & PCB  
✅ Simulated using Proteus  
✅ Designed PCB with labels & routing  
✅ No microcontroller required
