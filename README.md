# 🧠 Smart Curtain System

## 🔍 Overview
The **Smart Curtain System** is a hardware-based automation project that utilizes logic gates, switches, and an LDR sensor to control curtain movement based on ambient light and user-defined inputs — all without using any microcontroller.

---

## ⚙️ System Description
This project demonstrates how digital logic can be used to build a real-world automation system. The curtain automatically opens or closes based on light intensity and manual control signals, using basic logic gate circuits.

---

## 🔌 Main Inputs
- **LDR (Light Dependent Resistor):** Detects ambient light to enable automatic control.
- **LC (Local Control):** Manual switch to open or close the curtain.
- **SO (System Override):** Forces the curtain open or closed, overriding other inputs.
- **SC (Set Control):** Additional input for extended control functionality.

## 🔧 Logic Design
- Designed using **AND**, **OR**, **NOR**, and **NOT** gates.
- Built entirely with **TTL logic ICs** from the **7400 series**.
- No microcontroller or software code involved.
- Output connected to an **LED** to indicate system errors or curtain status.
